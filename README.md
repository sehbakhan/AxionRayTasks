Task 1 - Data Tagging

Guidelines:
The dataset consists of the following:
● Free-text data (Columns: Complaint, Cause, Correction) that needs to be tagged.
● Taxonomy Sheet: A reference list with predefined categories for Root Cause,
Symptom_Condition, Symptom_Component, Fix_Condition, and Fix_Component.
Your task is to tag the data by applying logical reasoning and aligning it with the
categories provided in the taxonomy.
*Note: Two Examples of how to tag the data are already provided in Task 1. Please refer to
those examples.

Deliverables for Task 1:
1. Submit the tagged dataset in CSV or Excel format.
2. A summary report (200-400 words) explaining -
a. How you approached the tagging of each given field (Root Cause,
Symptom_Condition, Symptom_Component, Fix_Condition, and Fix_Component.)
b. Any potential insights that can be generated if you have similar dataset but 10k
rows (Food for thought and has bonus marks)
Evaluation Criteria for Task 1:
● Tagging Accuracy: At least 50% tagging accuracy is expected.
● Critical Thinking: Ability to handle ambiguous cases and document observations.

## Task 2 - Data Analysis and Insights Generation using Python

Guidelines:
1. Column-Wise Analysis:
○ Perform a column-wise analysis of the provided dataset.
○ Describe each column in terms of its data type, unique values, distribution, and
overall significance for stakeholders
2. Data Cleaning:
○ Handle missing or invalid values using appropriate methods (e.g., imputation,
deletion).
○ Address inconsistencies in categorical columns (e.g., typos, inconsistent
capitalization).
○ Ensure numerical columns are in the correct format and free from outliers, where
applicable.
3. Identifying Critical Columns:
○ Select the top 5 critical columns that might be most insightful for stakeholders
according to your data understanding.
○ Provide reasoning for your selection.
○ Generate visualizations (e.g., bar plots etc) using Python to represent these
insights effectively. (atleast 3)
4. Generating tags/features from free text available :
○ Generate meaningful tags from the free text fields to summarize information,
example - failure conditions and components etc etc..
5. Summary and Insights (Food for thought and has bonus marks)
○ Write a summary of the tags generated, including potential insights derived from
the dataset.
○ Provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders based on your analysis.
○ Highlight discrepancies in the dataset (e.g., null values, missing primary keys)
and how did you approach.
Deliverables for Task 2:
1. Submit the cleaned and tagged records in CSV or Excel format.
2. Submit a detailed report covering the above pointers, including (Maximum 2 page):
a. Column analysis
b. Data cleaning summary and
c. Visualizations
d. Generated tags & Key takeaways
3. Attach Python scripts used for the analysis.
Evaluation Criteria for Task 2:
1. Demonstrates clear understanding of the dataset provided in summary reports.
2. Visualizations are relevant and easy to interpret, with well-supported insights derived
from exploratory data analysis.
3. Outputs, including scripts, datasets, and reports, are well-organized, professional, and
demonstrate attention to detail.
4. Bonus Points:
○ Unique and meaningful tags beyond failure conditions and components.
○ Comprehensive summary with actionable insights.
